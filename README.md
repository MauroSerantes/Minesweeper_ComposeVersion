## Tech Stack Used And Architectural pattern ‚öôÔ∏è

* Jetpack Compose - For the UI
* Navigation Component - For navigation between screend
* MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) - Main Architecture pattern
* Kotlin - The main language

### Personal Commentaries
_This time i use MVVM because it was more easy to integrate with jetpack compose declarative ui._
_The game view model controls all the logic of the game and provides a state updater based in the
user actions._
_The game works but it feels a kind of slow. It has to be the way that i implemented it. 
I continue learning Jetpack Compose and all its features._

_I use the same auxiliar data structures for the development of the game._
